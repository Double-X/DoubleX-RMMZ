 *    ## Plugin Info
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Plugin Name
 *      DoubleX RMMZ Unit Filters
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Introduction
 *      1. Without any plugin, getting a member with specific conditions
 *         relative to the belonging unit, like finding the party member with
 *         the highest amount of hp, demands relatively heavy event setups,
 *         even with the aid of common events, which boost event reusability.
 *      2. With this plugin, the same can be done using several easy, simple
 *         and small script calls instead of writing several common events
 *         from scratch, thus further improving effectiveness and efficiency.
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Prerequisites
 *      Abilities:
 *      1. Nothing special for most ordinary cases
 *      2. Little RMMZ plugin development proficiency to fully utilize this
 *         (Elementary Javascript exposures being able to write beginner codes
 *         up to 300LoC scale)
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Author Notes
 *      1. This plugin's meant to be a convenience tool to facilitate the use
 *         of some unit filters that aren't already available from the default
 *         RMMZ codebase, so you're still supposed to write some Javascript
 *         codes with the aid of the new script calls provided by this plugin.

 *         - Returns whether the battler involved has all states included by
 *           stateIds, which is a list of id of states
 *         - stateIds must be an Array of natural numbers

 *         - E.g.:
 *           $gameActors.actor(1).hasAllSkills([1, 2]) returns whether the
 *           actor with id 1 has all skills with id 1 and 2
 *      (v1.01a+)9. hasAnyUsableSkill(skillIds)
 *         - Returns whether the battler involved has any usable skill
 *           included by skillIds, which is a list of id of corresponding
 *           skills
 *         - paramIds must be an Array of natural numbers

 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    # Plugin Support Info:
 *      1. Prerequisites
 *         - Little RMMZ plugin development proficiency to fully comprehend
 *           this plugin
 *           (Elementary Javascript exposures being able to write beginner
 *           codes up to 300LoC scale)
 *      2. Parameter/Return value of type * means it might be of any type
 *      3. Function signature with (**) means it might take any number of
 *         parameters of any type
 *      4. Supposedly nullable variables are marked with the _ suffix in their
 *         names(but they can be sure to be non null in some cases)
 *      5. Functions supposedly returning nullable values are marked with the
 *         _ suffix in their names(but their return values can be sure to be
 *         non null in some cases)
